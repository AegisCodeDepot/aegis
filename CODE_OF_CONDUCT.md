# Aegis Code of Conduct

1.  **Don't be an asshole.** You don't know what the person across the
    screen has been through, and if the recent days happen to not be
    your days, I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate it if other people
    treat you badly either.
2.  **Please don't judge too much.** As I've said, you don't know what
    the person across the screen has been through. Sometimes people
    would request a feature which they intuitively believe to be
    necessary but struggle to find a rationale for; you should try to
    justify it and proceed accordingly as if you came up with the idea
    yourself. This is not to tell you *any* idea would be accepted -
    if your idea got rejected, you should also try to justify it and
    proceed accordingly as if you rejected the idea yourself.
3.  **In this house we practice proper meritocracy.** We don't take
    your other information into consideration when judging your
    contribution, please don't force them on us. If you still insist
    on telling everyone what category of person you are after reading
    this, whatever happens later would be solely your own
    responsibility.
4.  **Please focus on the technology side only.** For the project we
    strive for true neutrality; we do not endorse any non-tech
    statement in the name of the development team, so please do not
    make them in the name of the development team, even if you believe
    it's necessary to tell everyone that you're on the side of justice
    and how just you are.
